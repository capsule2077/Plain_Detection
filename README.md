# Plain_Detection ðŸš€

A minimal and clean object detector implementation from scratch â€” designed for clarity, extensibility, and learning. 

> âœ¨ Ongoing project: continuously evolving with better architecture, training tricks, and modern detection strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Build a **simple yet effective** object detection pipeline from the ground up
- Avoid unnecessary complexity â€” focus on readability and modularity
- Enable easy experimentation with different backbones, heads, and losses
- Serve as a clear and minimal entry-level reference for understanding object detection from scratch
